# TODOs

# Frontend

- Improve styling of pages
- Integrate wowranks.io API into add raider dialog to provide autocomplete for character name / realm
- Make raider overview prettier (class / spec icons, covenant colors, ilvl colors, etc)
- Sorting on columns is kinda broken
- Add charts and other visualizations to raid team page (roles / classes / specs)

# Backend

- Improve classes by having a constructor accept a `classOptions` object, which is an interface that contains all the class's properties (see https://github.com/blizzapi/blizzapi/blob/master/src/classes/BlizzAPI.ts for an example of what I mean)
- Implement the raider overview endpoint
    - Missing: enchants check
    - Unclear whether enchants will be processed on backend with a boolean for the frontend or full enchant information for the frontend which determines whether anything is missing
- Implement the raider details endpoint
- Unit tests
- E2E tests
- Figure out deployment / hosting (protect the API with basic auth if user awareness is still missing)
- Implement user awareness
- Add login via google and battle net
- Add endpoint for checking if a raid-team name is available
